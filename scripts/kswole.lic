  Automates the use of Feat Absorb and Feat Dispel for Kroderine Soul characters.
  Will use Mental Dispel (1218) for Mental Acuity characters if affordable when Feat Dispel is on cooldown.
  Depends on a library of creature spell prep messaging, submit new creature spell prep messaging via Github.
  Automates the use of Shield Mind for characters that know the shield specialization.
