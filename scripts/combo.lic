	Welcome Combo Script
	
	This script will do UCS fighting for you!
	It will start with JAB and take advantage of Tier Up opportunities.
	
	Once it has achieved Tier 3, it will always continue with your specified Tier attack.

  Version Control:
    Major_change.feature_addition.bugfix

  v3.5.0
    - Transferred authorship to Elanthia-Online, no other changes made
  v3.4.2
    - Fix more gross Takoa bugs
    - Fix bug where the toohigh setting would restart your aim locations
    - It will only make a single attack using the toohigh location before resuming your normal aiming list
  v3.4.1
    - Fix Takoa's gross bigshot code terribleness. 
    - Fix bug where if you haven't set the bigshot always_flee_from/flee_count settings, it would auto exit
  v3.4
    -Now targets crap with weird names. Thank Genstealer for complaining about it.
  v3.3
    -The moment Takoa butchered this script! 
    -Direct all complaints regarding the following issues to Takoa:

    -Will focus mstrike using your tier3 attack when possible
    -If you have Krynch active, will try to <tier3> your <aim> location first
        if mstrike is on cooldown
    -Exits if your bigshot ALWAYS FLEE FROM or FLEE COUNT conditions are met
        if bigshot is running, ignores otherwise
    -Has a new TOOHIGH setting for aimed attacks for taller targets, will go to that
        if you get a "cannot reach" message. For instance, if you set your normal
        aim location to be "head", and your "toohigh" to be "left leg" it will
        always try to punch the head first, if you get the "too high" message it
        will then switch to the left leg. Once the head is reachable it will then
        hit that again
    -Will now only try to mstrike if you have >= 30 ranks of MOC. Noobs.
    -Fixed bug that wasn't starting attack routine when krynch not active
  v3.2 
    -Stance option
  v3.1
    -Changed pause to sleep for lich 4.6 update
  v3.0
    -Added stand check
    -Added ability to specify a target
    (Alllll untested!!! So use at your own damn risk!!)
  v2.9
    -Damn you calm bastards
  v2.8
    -Added exiting when the target is dead (probably)
  v2.7
    -Fixed broken aiming cycling.
  v2.6:
    -Doesn't aim your jabs for faster tier up.
  v2.5:
    -Caught kicking while lying down
    -Caught stunned/webbed/generic failures
  v2.4:
    -Added aiming
  v2.3:
    -Making it stop after killing one target.
    -Added tierup settings and tier3 attack settings.
  v2.2:
    -Added waiting for RT to end, spam attacks 1 second before rt ends.
  v2.1:
    -Added setting of your default tier 3 attack
  v2.0: 
    -Completely rewritten to include debug messages
    -Now correctly tier's up to Tier 3 instead of getting stuck in one attack
    -Will default back to jab to achieve higher Tiers if not at highest Tier.
    -Added detection of hit/miss, will continue the vulnerable attack until success
